To using UIKit, you implement the following steps in your app:

- Create an instance of the viewer
  Declare and initialize an instance of the UIKit viewer.

  - When you execute the join command, your app joins the channel, publishes the local audio and video streams to Agora and handles audio and video for anyone else who joins the call in a default UI.
  - Yes, you read that right. After initializing a viewer instance, you can create or join a channel with just one line of code.

## Prerequisites

To follow this procedure you must have:

## Project setup

In order to create the environment necessary to integrate {props.product} into your {props.client} using {props.sdk}, do the following:
